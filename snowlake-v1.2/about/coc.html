        <h3>THE SHORT VERSION</h3>
        <p>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.
          All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate.
          We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form.
          Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.</p>

        <h3>THE LONGER VERSION</h3>
        <h5> NumFOCUS Diversity Statement</h5>
        <p>NumFOCUS welcomes and encourages participation in our community by people of all backgrounds and identities. We are committed to promoting and sustaining a culture that values mutual respect, tolerance, and learning, and we work together as a community to help each other live out these values.
          We have created this diversity statement because we believe that a diverse community is stronger, more vibrant, and produces better software and better science. A diverse community where people treat each other with respect has more potential contributors, more sources for ideas, and fewer shared assumptions that might hinder development or research.
          Although we have phrased the formal diversity statement generically to make it all-inclusive, we recognize that there are specific identities that are impacted by systemic discrimination and marginalization. We welcome all people to participate in the NumFOCUS community regardless of their identity or background.
        </p>
        <br> <br>
        <h5>NumFOCUS Code of Conduct: Introduction & Scope</h5>
        <p>This code of conduct should be honored by everyone who participates in the NumFOCUS community. It should be honored in any NumFOCUS-related activities, by anyone claiming affiliation with NumFOCUS, and especially when someone is representing NumFOCUS in any role (including as an event volunteer or speaker).
          This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by NumFOCUS, including all public and private mailing lists, issue trackers, wikis, forums, and any other communication channel used by our community. The code of conduct equally applies at NumFOCUS events and governs standards of behavior for attendees, speakers, volunteers, booth staff, and event sponsors.          
          This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our understanding of a collaborative, inclusive community culture. Please try to follow this code in spirit as much as in letter, to create a friendly and productive environment that enriches the NumFOCUS community.  
          We require all NumFOCUS sponsored and affiliated projects to adopt a code of conduct for their project that encourages a productive, respectful environment for all open source contributors and community members. The NumFOCUS Code of Conduct follows below.
        </p>
        <br> <br>
        <h5>Standards for Behavior</h5>
        <p>NumFOCUS is a worldwide community. All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds.
          <b>Please always be kind and courteous. There’s never a need to be mean or rude or disrespectful.</b> Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.
        </p>
        <h6><b>We Strive to:</b></h6>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Be empathetic, welcoming, friendly, and patient.</b><p>We remember that every NumFOCUS project and program is crafted by human beings who deserve to be treated with kindness and empathy. We work together to resolve conflict and assume good intentions. We may all experience some frustration from time to time, but we do not allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.</p></li>
          <li><b>Be collaborative.</b><p> Our work depends on the participation of many people, and in turn others depend on our work. Open source communities depend on effective and friendly collaboration to achieve their goals.</p></li>
          <li><b>Be inquisitive.</b><p>Nobody knows everything! Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so we encourage questions, although we may direct them to the appropriate forum. We will try hard to be responsive and helpful.</p></li>
          <li><b>Be careful in the words that we choose.</b>We are careful and respectful in our communication and we take responsibility for our own speech. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other members of the community.</li>
        </ul>
        <br> <br>
        <h5>Unacceptable Behavior</h5>
        <p>We are committed to making participation in this community a harassment-free experience.
