<p>This article was recently published in the PLOS Journal by funders at CZI and the Sloan Foundation.  Data Umbrella received a mention in there for community building:</p>

<p><em>Groups like Outreachy, Data Umbrella, and PyLadies are all great examples of communities of practice that specialize in promoting and supporting underrepresented groups. Local communities of practice are also important: They have cultural, geographic, and human language expertise that can make open source interactions more welcoming for new participants from the area.</em></p>
